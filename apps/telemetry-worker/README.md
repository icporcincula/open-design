# Open Design Telemetry Relay

Cloudflare Worker relay for opt-in Open Design telemetry. The shipped desktop
client sends redacted Langfuse ingestion batches here after the user enables
metrics. This Worker holds the Langfuse write credentials and forwards valid
batches to Langfuse.

The relay keeps Langfuse secret keys out of packaged clients. Release builds
only include the public relay URL; the Worker adds Langfuse authentication
server-side after validating the request. If the relay is unavailable, the
daemon retries, logs the failure, and continues the user flow without blocking
the CLI or desktop app.

The same Worker also exposes a write-only trace object ingest endpoint at
`POST /api/objects/batch`. It accepts Open Design observability objects such as
attachments, produced artifacts, and over-threshold input text snapshots, writes
them through the `TRACE_OBJECT_BUCKET` R2 binding, and returns trace-safe
`storage_ref` / `sha256` / size metadata for Langfuse manifests.

Object ingest uses a Worker-issued short-lived upload token. Released daemon
telemetry first requests authorization with object metadata only, then uploads
only objects covered by that token. The long-lived signing secret stays in the
Worker and is never packaged into the daemon/client.

Local development can bypass the relay by setting direct `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`
and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables for the daemon. Packaged
release config should use only `OPEN_DESIGN_TELEMETRY_RELAY_URL`.

## Abuse controls

The Worker requires the Open Design telemetry marker header, validates the
Langfuse ingestion batch shape and size before forwarding, and uses Cloudflare
Rate Limiting bindings for two independent keys:

- `TELEMETRY_CLIENT_RATE_LIMITER`: anonymous installation/user id, 120 requests
  per minute.
- `TELEMETRY_IP_RATE_LIMITER`: Cloudflare `CF-Connecting-IP`, 600 requests per
  minute.

Object ingest uses the same rate limit bindings with a separate marker value,
`X-Open-Design-Telemetry: object-ingestion-v1`. The daemon calls
`POST /api/objects/authorize` with `client_id`, `project_id`, `run_id`, and the
object metadata (`storage_ref`, object class, size, and sha256); the Worker signs
a 5-minute token scoped to exactly those objects. `POST /api/objects/batch`
must include that token, and the Worker re-checks the namespace, size, and
sha256 before writing to R2. The Worker also applies IP rate limiting before
reading object bodies. It enforces a 10 MiB single-object limit and a 20 MiB
request-body limit by default. Oversized objects are reported as unavailable
instead of being written.

## Secrets

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/telemetry-worker dlx wrangler secret put LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
pnpm --dir apps/telemetry-worker dlx wrangler secret put LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
pnpm --dir apps/telemetry-worker dlx wrangler secret put TRACE_OBJECT_UPLOAD_SECRET
```

`LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` defaults to `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` in
`wrangler.toml`.

Object ingest should use a Cloudflare R2 binding, not S3/R2 access keys in the
packaged client or daemon. Required worker configuration:

```toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "TRACE_OBJECT_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "open-design-observability"

[vars]
TRACE_OBJECT_PREFIX = "observability"
TRACE_OBJECT_MAX_BYTES = "10485760"
TRACE_OBJECT_BATCH_MAX_BYTES = "20971520"
```

## Deploy

```bash
pnpm --filter @open-design/telemetry-worker deploy
```

After deploy, set the repository variable `OPEN_DESIGN_TELEMETRY_RELAY_URL` to
the Worker route, for example:

```text
https://telemetry.open-design.ai/api/langfuse
```

Opening `/api/langfuse` or `/health` in a browser returns relay health JSON.
Telemetry ingestion still uses POST to `/api/langfuse`.
Object ingestion uses POST to `/api/objects/batch`.

Release workflows bake only this public relay URL into packaged config. The
Langfuse secret key stays in Cloudflare Worker secrets.
